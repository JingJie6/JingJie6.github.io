Everyone is the same, there is no smarter or more foolish. People don't konw anything before they learn. In my opinion,
The reason why have smart people and stupid people, not because of they are smart enough or just too stupid to learn. This
is because the smart people know how to ask question. Asking questions the "Smart way" is one of the most important 
communication skills for all of us, not only for software engineering. when you are doing group exercise, you may occur
some problems that you dont konw, but that's okay, just say something relate to the question. That's one big step to help 
your team to lead the answer. The way to learn is ask question, but How to ask question the smart way? according to the 
guidelines for effective interaction with the open source community that Eric Raymond wrote. people should google search 
before they ask question. google is our friend, because a lot of questions can be find it on google.

Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmer. I found some smart question examples
and stupid question examples from the website, and I will go through them to show what is smart question and what is stupid 
question. In this site, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37713965/somethings-wrong-with-my-code-to-calculate-change-money">Something's Wrong With My Code To Calculate Change Money</a>, 
we can see that [duplicate] next to the title, which mean someone had asked this question before. Therefore, this site
marked as duplicate by StackOverflow. This is a example of stupid question, because according to the precepts by Eric Raymond, 
people shouold google search before ask question. obviously, This person didnt do that. here is an example about smart 
question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41057755/eclipse-neon-cannot-start-a-java-debug-session">Eclipse Neon cannot start a java debug session</a>,
why I think this is a smart question? first, from the title, this person ask question clearly and
also mention the version of Eclipse. second, this person explain his situation very clearly and detail, also he have 
the error output which will help people to help him solve the propblem. last, He tagged some words relate to his question,
this is good and this will help people effective help him out.
