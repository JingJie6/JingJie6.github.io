	Do you know why is configuration management important to software engineering? And why do we need it? In nowadays, I can say most of careers require teamwork, because it is 
almost impossible to build a large and complex program in short time, if you are working alone. Therefore, why we need teamwork. Teamwork is just like recursion, we divided 
the problem to smaller parts and every team member finish their own part and combine all the small parts. However, this will occur some problems, imagine multiple people working
 on a same project, if someone mistype a variable, this will make a big changed to the project. Because it is so hard to find that mistake for other people. That’s why we need
 configuration management. 
	Configuration management is an important skill for software engineer. Configuration management allow multiple people to access the same project, and it keep tracks and
 control the changes. So, we will know who made change, where the change made and what was the change.  It will help people to find the change or mistake base on that.
 	I think github is popular because of Git. What is Git? Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files.Git not like other control system such as
 CVCS, because most Operations in Git only need local files to operate, which mean no information is needed from another computer on the network. For example, if you want to
 see the history of your project, Git doesn’t have to go to the server to get the history. Git will just display your history directly from your local database, which mean you
 can see your project instantly. Therefore, I think github is popular because of Git.
