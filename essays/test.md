  Do you know why is configuration management important to software engineering? And why do we need it? In nowadays, I can say most of careers require team experience, because I don’t care how smart you are and how fast you work. You only have one brain and a pair of hands, it is impossible to build a large and complex program in short time. However, that’s why we need team experience. Team is just like recursion, we divided the problem to smaller part and every team member finish their own part and combine all the small parts. However, this will occur some problems, because everyone has their own coding style. That’s why we need configuration management.
