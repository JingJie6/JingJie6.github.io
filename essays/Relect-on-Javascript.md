What is JavaScript? I don’t know. This is my first impression about JavaScript. Before I take this course, I was completed newbie. However, I have learned Java before, and I am learning C in this semester. After I finished the tutorial of JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp, and I realized JavaScript was not that hard to learn for people who have no experience.

In my opinion, JavaScript is a very good language compare to Java. There are many similarities between JavaScript and Java. For example, “for loop”, “while loop”, “if-else statement” and “switch”, etc. These similarities made me feel comfortable with JavaScript. However, I think JavaScript is easier than Java, even though I had some Java language experience. because even these two languages have many similarities, but they still have some differences. In Java language, we have to care about the visible problem. Such as public class, private class, protect class and no modifier. And we have to declare the type of the variable, like “Integer”, “long”, “float” and “Array”, etc. In JavaScript, we don’t need to care about these thing, there is no visible problem and we don’t need to declare the type of variable. Also, JavaScript is a very great programming language since it is widely used in many Companies and applications. Therefore, I think JavaScript is a good programming language for learning.

The practices WODs were helpful and I liked it. Because we attempted to do the practice first then watch how our professor solve it. In this order, we will deeply think about the question and try to solve it by ourselves. Then compare the solution to professor’s solution, we may find out some easy ways to solve the problem, or what mistake have you made. This better than just watch the solution without thinking.
